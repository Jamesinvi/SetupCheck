**I'm happy to announce** [Warcraft-Data](http://www.warcraft-data.com) **is now live!**

[http://www.warcraft-data.com/](http://www.warcraft-data.com/)  is a new website where you will be able to see statistics for your class/spec compiled from warcraftlogs's data. It will display information to better understand what build to play and how to optimize for a specific raid/encounter.

&#x200B;

To get the data you must select:

* Difficulty
* your Class
* your Spec
* The number of pages you want to pull from warcraftLogs (more data gets more accurate results but it takes more time to process it (if you're on a pc it shoudln't matter how many you ask for).
* Raid
* Boss

and you're off! You'll see displayed graphs describing:

* How many times a given combo was found
* The best score for any given combo found
* The itemLevel of that best scoring parse
* The best azerite traits (including double or triple variants of every trait to understand whether you should stack a trait or not)

All the bar graphs are zoomable to better understand the data (just click and drag to zoom).

&#x200B;

*Support for M+ and essences top priority for development. The website is free and I have no intention of changing that!*

I hope you like it and feel free to give any suggestions and feedback, I will be happy to answer you :) . The project is open source and available [here](https://github.com/Jamesinvi/Warcraft-Data). Feel free to pull request if you wish to add any functionality
